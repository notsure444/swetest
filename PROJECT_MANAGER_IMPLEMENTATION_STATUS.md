  - History tracking and audit trail

- **Agent Task Assignment** (`assignAgentTasks`)
  - Coordination between all 7 agent types
  - Task assignment with dependencies
  - Priority-based scheduling
  - Agent availability management
  - Progress tracking

- **Progress Tracking** (`updateProjectProgress`)

  - Recent activity logs
  - AI-generated insights
  - Performance analytics

#### 2. ✅ Enhanced Database Schema
- **Updated Projects Table**
  - Added priority, complexity, lifecycle, metrics, agentAssignments
  - Enhanced configuration with business goals, constraints
  - 14 comprehensive status states

- **New Tables Added**
  - `deliverables`: Tracking project deliverables with acceptance criteria
  - `evaluations`: Quality assessment with automated checks
  - `projectInfrastructure`: Container and isolation management
  - `agentNotifications`: Agent coordination and communication

- **Enhanced Existing Tables**
  - `agents`: Added availability, reservation, task assignment
  - `systemLogs`: Added categorization for better organization

#### 3. ✅ Dashboard Integration
- **Enhanced CreateProjectModal**
  - AI-assisted project setup
  - Intelligent suggestions based on project type and requirements
  - Comprehensive form with deliverables and evaluations
  - Integration with enhanced project creation system
  - Error handling and user feedback

#### 4. ✅ Project Isolation Controls
- **Complete Separation Between Projects**
  - Unique namespace generation for each project
  - Container infrastructure management
  - Agent assignment isolation
  - Resource separation
  - Security boundaries

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Agent Coordination
- 7 specialized agent types: ProjectManager, SystemArchitect, TaskPlanner, CodeGenerator, TestEngineer, QAAnalyst, DeploymentEngineer
- State-based agent activation (different agents for different lifecycle phases)
- Task dependency management
- Load balancing and resource allocation

#### Project Lifecycle States
1. `planning` - Initial project setup and requirements gathering
2. `architecture` - System design and architecture planning
3. `task_breakdown` - Detailed task planning and decomposition
4. `development` - Active development phase
5. `testing` - Testing and QA phase
6. `integration` - Integration testing and system assembly
7. `deployment_prep` - Deployment preparation and staging
8. `deployment` - Production deployment
9. `validation` - Post-deployment validation and monitoring
10. `maintenance` - Ongoing maintenance and updates
11. `completed` - Project fully completed
12. `paused` - Temporarily paused
13. `cancelled` - Project cancelled
14. `failed` - Project failed

#### AI-Assisted Features
- Project type-based suggestions (web, mobile, fullstack)
- Complexity-based recommendations (simple, moderate, complex, enterprise)
- Tech stack optimization suggestions
- Timeline and resource estimation
- Architecture pattern recommendations

#### Integration Points
- **Existing Agent System**: Seamless integration with AgentManager class
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Compatible with existing workflow system
- **Dashboard Components**: Enhanced CreateProjectModal integration
- **Container Infrastructure**: Docker Compose compatibility
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `convex/projectManager.ts` (33KB) - Complete project management system

#### Modified Files
- `convex/schema.ts` - Enhanced database schema with 4 new tables
- `dashboard/src/components/CreateProjectModal.tsx` - Enhanced UI integration

### Quality Assurance

#### Code Quality
- TypeScript with strict typing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation with Convex validators
- Rate limiting for AI API calls
- Proper async/await patterns

#### Integration Quality
- Seamless integration with existing agent system
- Compatible with workflow orchestration
- Dashboard integration with real-time updates
- Container infrastructure compatibility

#### Security
- Project isolation through namespaces
- Rate limiting on AI suggestions
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure agent coordination

## Summary

The comprehensive project management system has been successfully implemented with all required functionality:

✅ **Functions for creating projects with deliverables and evaluations**
✅ **Managing project lifecycle states across all development phases**  
✅ **Coordinating between the 7 different agent types with proper task assignment and progress tracking**
✅ **Integrating with the dashboard to provide AI-assisted project setup**
✅ **Intelligent suggestions based on project type and requirements**
✅ **Project isolation controls to ensure complete separation between concurrent projects**

The implementation provides a robust, scalable, and comprehensive project management system that enables autonomous AI agents to handle end-to-end app development with proper coordination, tracking, and isolation.
