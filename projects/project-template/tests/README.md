## Testing Strategy

The testing infrastructure supports:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Test system performance characteristics
- **Security Tests**: Test security boundaries and constraints

## Agent Testing

Test Engineer agents will:
- Generate comprehensive test suites
- Maintain test coverage requirements
- Implement automated testing pipelines
- Ensure quality gates are met before deployment

## Isolation

Tests run in isolated containers to ensure:
- No interference between project tests
- Consistent testing environments
- Proper resource allocation
- Security boundary enforcement
