# Multi-Project Isolation Architecture - Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED - Task 2: Build multi-project isolation architecture

### Core Architecture Overview

The multi-project isolation architecture provides complete separation between concurrent projects while sharing core infrastructure services. Each project operates in its own isolated environment with dedicated containers for development, testing, and deployment.

### 🏗️ Project Lifecycle Management (`convex/projects.ts`)

#### Key Functions Implemented:
- **`createProject()`** - Creates isolated project with unique namespace and container configuration
- **`updateProjectStatus()`** - Manages project lifecycle with automatic agent provisioning
- **`getProject()` / `listProjects()`** - Query functions with isolation-aware data access
- **`deleteProject()`** - Complete cleanup including containers, data, and resources

#### Project Isolation Features:
```typescript
// Each project gets:
- Unique namespace: `project_${timestamp}_${randomId}`
- Isolated RAG namespace for semantic code search
- Container configurations for dev/test/deploy environments
- Resource limits and security boundaries
- Dedicated network and volume configuration
```

### 🐳 Containerization Strategy (`docker/` directory)

#### 1. **Shared Services Architecture** (`docker/docker-compose.base.yml`)
```yaml
Services:
- convex-backend: Core Convex backend (shared)
- dashboard: AI-assisted dashboard (shared)
- redis: Caching and session management
- nginx: Reverse proxy with project routing
- prometheus/grafana: Monitoring infrastructure
```

#### 2. **Project Template System** (`docker/project-template.yml`)
```yaml
Per-project containers:
- ${PROJECT_NAMESPACE}_dev: Development environment
- ${PROJECT_NAMESPACE}_test: Testing environment  
- ${PROJECT_NAMESPACE}_deploy: Deployment/preview environment
- ${PROJECT_NAMESPACE}_db: Optional database container

Isolation Features:
- Project-specific networks and volumes
- Resource limits (CPU/memory/storage)
- Security boundaries (read-only filesystems, user namespaces)
- Dynamic port allocation and routing
```

#### 3. **Dynamic Container Management** (`docker/project-manager.js`)
```javascript
Features:
- Template-based container generation
- Tech stack-specific configurations (React, Node.js, Python)
- Project structure initialization
- Container lifecycle management (start/stop/cleanup)
- Network and volume management
```

#### 4. **Routing and Load Balancing** (`docker/nginx/nginx.conf`)
```nginx
Features:
- Project-specific routing: /projects/{namespace}/*
- Rate limiting per project namespace
- Security headers and isolation
- Load balancing and health checks
```

### 🔒 Security and Isolation Features

#### Container Security:
- **User Namespaces**: All containers run as non-root user (1000:1000)
- **Read-only Filesystems**: Where possible, with specific writable mounts
- **No New Privileges**: Prevents privilege escalation
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and storage constraints
- **Temporary Filesystems**: Limited /tmp access with noexec

#### Network Isolation:
- **Project-specific Networks**: Each project has dedicated network
- **Controlled Shared Access**: Limited access to shared services
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-project and per-IP rate limiting
- **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, CSRF protection, etc.

#### Data Isolation:
- **Convex Namespaces**: Complete database-level isolation
- **Volume Separation**: Dedicated volumes per project
- **RAG Isolation**: Semantic search isolated by project namespace

### 📊 Resource Management

#### Dynamic Resource Allocation:
```typescript
Resource Limits (configurable per project):
- CPU: 0.5-2.0 cores (development: 2, testing: 1, deploy: 1)
- Memory: 512MB-2GB (development: 2GB, testing: 1GB, deploy: 1GB)
- Storage: Project-specific volumes with cleanup policies
- Network: Isolated subnets with controlled routing
```

#### Monitoring and Logging:
- **Container Health Checks**: All containers have health endpoints
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with Fluent Bit
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus integration for all containers
- **Resource Usage Tracking**: CPU, memory, and network monitoring

### 🔄 Project Lifecycle Integration

#### Status-Based Actions:
1. **Created → Planning**: Automatic agent creation
2. **Planning → Development**: Container preparation and resource allocation
3. **Development → Testing**: Test environment activation
4. **Testing → Deployment**: Production-like container setup
5. **Paused**: Container hibernation to save resources
6. **Failed**: Automatic cleanup and resource reclamation

### 🚀 Technical Implementation

#### File Structure:
```
docker/
├── docker-compose.base.yml     # Shared services
├── project-template.yml        # Project container template
├── project-manager.js          # Container management utility
├── nginx/

└── (monitoring configs)

convex/
└── projects.ts                # Project lifecycle management

docker-compose.yml             # Main orchestration file
```

#### Integration Points:
- **Agent System**: Projects auto-create agents when entering planning phase
- **RAG Component**: Automatic namespace isolation for semantic code search
- **Workflow System**: Ready for multi-step project workflows
- **Dashboard**: Real-time project status and container monitoring

### 🎯 Isolation Verification

#### Complete Separation Achieved:
- ✅ **Data Isolation**: Convex namespaces prevent cross-project data access
- ✅ **Container Isolation**: Docker namespaces and network separation
- ✅ **Resource Isolation**: CPU, memory, and storage limits enforced
- ✅ **Network Isolation**: Project-specific networks with controlled routing
- ✅ **Security Isolation**: User namespaces and security boundaries

#### Shared Services Maintained:
- ✅ **Convex Backend**: Centralized with namespace-aware data access
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Single interface managing all projects
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Unified monitoring across all project containers
- ✅ **Registry**: Shared container registry for custom images

### ✅ Task Completion Verification

**Requirements Met:**
1. ✅ **`convex/projects.ts`** - Created with comprehensive project lifecycle management
2. ✅ **Project sandboxing using Convex namespaces** - Implemented with unique namespaces per project
3. ✅ **Containerization strategy with Docker Compose files in `docker/` directory** - Complete architecture created
4. ✅ **Isolated environments for each project** - Separate containers for code execution, testing, and deployment
5. ✅ **Shared core services** - Convex backend and dashboard remain shared while projects are isolated

**Architecture Ready For:**
- ✅ Agent workflow orchestration (Task 3)
- ✅ Dashboard development (Task 4)  
- ✅ Agent tooling integration (Task 5)
- ✅ End-to-end testing and validation (Task 8)
